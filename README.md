Welcome to my portfolio repository!
I'm currently in the early stages of my journey as a developer. While this portfolio is still under construction and doesn’t have live projects yet, it's the starting point of my continuous learning and building process.

👨‍💻 What I’m Working On
Right now, I'm focused on building a solid foundation by working on:

Small personal projects

Web design fundamentals

Frontend and backend basics

Software development best practices

🎯 Goal
To grow my skills and eventually showcase full-featured software and web applications that I’ve built myself — from UI/UX design to development and deployment.

🛠️ Tech Stack I’m Exploring
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Git & GitHub

Responsive web design

Basic app logic and architecture

UI tools like Figma

🚀 Coming Soon
Live demo links

Project case studies

Blog-style project breakdowns

Real-world applications
